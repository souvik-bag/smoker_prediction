# Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals

The tobacco epidemic remains a major public health threat, causing over 8 million deaths annually. Smoking is a key driver of this crisis. This project aims to classify adult smoking status using biosignals such as age, height, weight, and cholesterol levels, providing valuable insights for public health agencies. Our best model, XGBoost, used 500 rounds, η = 0.09 to reduce overfitting, max depth = 7, and γ = 2, achieving an AUC of 0.881 on test data and a Kaggle score of 0.87131. The second-best model, a neural network with two hidden layers (50 units each), ReLU activation, and 0.4 dropout, achieved a Kaggle score of 0.85661.
